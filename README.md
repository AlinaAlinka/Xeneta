These automated tests were created with Python. The test path is Xeneta\Test1.

I was using PyCharm framework and Selenium WebDriver. 
As a browser, I was using Chrome so to run test cases you'll need chromedriver. The file chromedriver.exe is also attached to the email. 
You'll just need to edit the path in the test case code (I've added the comment in the code also).

Run test cases:

Every test case is in the separate .py file. The description of every test case is provided in the Test Automation Engineer_Solved Task.docx file.

To run a test case you can double-click on the .py file or open in Python IDE (I was using Pycharm), open the folder with test cases, and run them with the "Run" button.
 
You can also run all test set from the folder. 
To execute this from the Pycarm IDE you'll need to install pytest package (Settings/Project:Xeneta/Python Interpreter/+/Search for pytest/Install Package.) 
Right-click on the folder 'Test1' and Run 'Unittests in Test1'.

Pycharm installation files for Mac and wor Windows unfortunatelly are too big and I cannot attach them here. But they are in the folder on Google drive (in case if you need to install Pycharm).
